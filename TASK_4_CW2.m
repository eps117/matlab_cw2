% TASK 4: REFLECTIVE STATEMENT [5 MARKS]

% One of the challenges I faced this courework was in task 2, where I
% could not get the LEDs to turn on whilst the programme was running. I
% also was not able to get my live plot working fully as it was not showing
% the plot. Another challenge I faced was in both task 2 and 3, as I was
% unable to create a function for temp_prediction and temp_monitor as
% different amber wanrings would appear saying different variables were unused.
% However, one strength I had was task 1 in general, as printing text to
% the screen using fprintf was previously learnt in the last coursework, so
% I could call upon my previous knowledge.
% A limitation I experienced was my lack of understanding when it came to
% running a programme for an indefinite time, as that requires 'while true'
% statements and infinite loops which is not a strong point of mine
% If I was to repeat this coursework, I would improve on my knowledge of
% infinite loops and while true statements. In addition to this I would
% try and understand how to live plot graphs to show the data from the code
% whilst it is running indefinitely.
